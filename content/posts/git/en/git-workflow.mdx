Git is an essential version control tool in modern software development. Using the right workflow makes team collaboration much smoother.

## Branch Strategy

### Git Flow

```bash
# Main branches
main          # Production code
develop       # Development branch

# Supporting branches
feature/      # New features
release/      # Release preparation
hotfix/       # Emergency fixes
```

### GitHub Flow (for simple projects)

```bash
main          # Always deployable
feature/      # Feature development branch
```

## Commit Message Rules

### Conventional Commits

```
feat: Add new feature
fix: Bug fix
docs: Documentation changes
style: Code formatting
refactor: Code refactoring
test: Add tests
chore: Build configuration, etc.
```

### Examples

```bash
git commit -m "feat: Add user authentication"
git commit -m "fix: Fix login error"
git commit -m "docs: Update README"
```

## Branch Workflow

```bash
# 1. Get latest code
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Create new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/user-authentication

# 3. Work and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Implement login form"

# 4. Push to remote repository
git push origin feature/user-authentication

# 5. Create Pull Request
```

## Writing Pull Requests

A good PR should include:

1. **Clear title**: What was changed
2. **Description**: Why and how it was changed
3. **Checklist**: Items for reviewers to check
4. **Screenshots**: If there are UI changes

## Resolving Conflicts

```bash
# When conflict occurs
git checkout feature/my-feature
git merge main

# After fixing conflict files
git add .
git commit -m "resolve: Fix merge conflict"
```

## Useful Git Commands

```bash
# Check changes
git status
git diff

# Commit history
git log --oneline --graph

# Branch management
git branch -a
git branch -d feature/old-feature

# Undo changes
git reset --soft HEAD~1
git revert <commit-hash>
```

## Conclusion

Using a consistent Git workflow makes team collaboration smoother and improves code quality. It's important to choose a branch strategy that fits your project size and write clear commit messages.
