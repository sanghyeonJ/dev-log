## Currency Calculation

Let's create a program that divides the amount entered by the user into 100 yen, 10 yen, 5 yen, and 1 yen coins
and calculates how many of each coin are needed.  

This example is a representative basic case of the Greedy Algorithm.

### Key Idea
1. Divide starting from the largest coin.
2. The quotient is the number of that coin
3. The remainder is used for the next coin calculation
4. Repeat this process  
##### `This way, you can always make change with the minimum number of coins.`

### Coin Array
To make it easy to modify currency denominations, manage currency denominations as an array.
```java
int[] coins = {100, 10, 5, 1};
```

### Coin Calculation
Divide the entered amount by the value of the larger coin to find the number of coins needed.  
Assign the remaining amount to the price variable to use for calculating the number of the next coin.
```java
for (int i = 0; i < coins.length; i++) {
    result[i] = price / coins[i]; // quotient = number of coins
    price = price % coins[i];     // remaining amount
}
```

### Result Output
Use a for loop to output the amount for each currency denomination.
```java
for(int i = 0; i < coins.length; i++) {
    System.out.println(coins[i] + " yen coin : " + result[i] + " pieces");
}
```

### Complete Code
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    
    System.out.print("price : ");
    int price = sc.nextInt();
    
    int[] coins = {100, 10, 5, 1};
    int[] result = new int[coins.length];
    
    for(int i = 0; i < coins.length; i++) {
        result[i] = price / coins[i];
        price = price % coins[i];
    }
    
    for(int i = 0; i < coins.length; i++) {
        System.out.println(coins[i] + " yen coin : " + result[i] + " pieces");
    }

}
```
