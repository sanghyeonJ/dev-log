## Program to Sort Array Values in Ascending Order

Create a program that sorts the numeric array 30, 355, 24, 12, 98, 72, 5, 76, 60, 35, 54, 62, 2, 12, 35 in ascending order.  
Use insertion sort as the sorting method.  

### Overview of Insertion Sort
1. Assume the left portion is always sorted
2. Take one element from the right
3. Compare with the left and shift elements one position to the right until the correct position for the taken value is found
4. Place the taken value in that position

### Complete Code
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {

    int[] arr = {30, 355, 24, 12, 98, 72, 5, 76, 60, 35, 54, 62, 2, 12, 35};
    
    // Assume first element is sorted, start comparing from the second as target
    for(int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
        int target = arr[i];  // Value to insert
        int j = i - 1;
        
        // If left value is greater than target, shift right by one
        // and move comparison index left to compare with the next value
        while( j >= 0 && arr[j] > target) {
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
            j--;
        }
        
        // Insert target at the correct position
        arr[j+1] = target;
    }

}
```
