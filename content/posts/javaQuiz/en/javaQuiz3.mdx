## Program to Sort Array Values in Ascending Order

Create a program that sorts the numeric array 30, 355, 24, 12, 98, 72, 5, 76, 60, 35, 54, 62, 2, 12, 35 in ascending order.  
Use insertion sort as the sorting method.  

### Insertion Sort Summary
- Insertion sort keeps the left part of the array as a sorted region,
- takes one value at a time from the right and compares it with the sorted part from the right side.
- If the value in the sorted part is larger, shift it one position to the right; repeat until the taken value is larger.
- When the taken value is larger, place it in that position.

### 1. Set key and value to compare

```java
for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    int key = arr[i];
    int j = i - 1;
}
```

- Assume the first value (index 0) is sorted and set the second value (index 1) as key.

### 2. Find position for key

```java
while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > key) {
    arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
    j--;
}
```

- Down to index 0
- Compare index j with key; if the value at j is larger,
- move that value to the right and compare with the next value.
- Repeat until key is larger

### 3. Insert key

```java
arr[j + 1] = key;
```

- When the value at j is smaller than key, insert key at the position after j.

### Complete Code

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {

    int[] arr = {30, 355, 24, 12, 98, 72, 5, 76, 60, 35, 54, 62, 2, 12, 35};
    
    for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
        int key = arr[i];
        int j = i - 1;

        // Shift values greater than key to the right
        while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > key) {
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j];
            j--;
        }

        // Insert key
        arr[j + 1] = key;
    }

}
```
