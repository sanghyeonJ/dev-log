### Packages

##### Var1

```java
package variable;

public class Var1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(10);
        System.out.println(10);
        System.out.println(10);
    }
}
```

- You can think of packages as folders used to organize Java files.
- If you create a package called `variable`, you must declare the package to which the Java file belongs, such as `package variable;`, on the first line of Java files that belong to that package.
- The package where the Java file is located and the `package variable` declaration location must match.

#### Execution Result

```bash
10
10
10
```

This is code that simply outputs the number 10 three times. Now let's modify the code to output the number 20 three times instead of outputting 10 three times.

```java
package variable;

public class Var1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(20);  //Changed 10 -> 20
        System.out.println(20);  //Changed 10 -> 20
        System.out.println(20);  //Changed 10 -> 20
    }
}
```

You need to find all places where the number 10 is written and change them to 20. In this case, a total of 3 code changes occurred.
Since it's a simple example, we only changed the code 3 times, but if there were 100 places outputting the number 10, we would need to change all 100 pieces of code.

Furthermore, what if we want users to input a number and output the number they entered? The value entered by users always changes. Someone might enter 100, and someone else might enter 200. (User input will be covered later)
Ultimately, we need a storage space where we can store values somewhere and retrieve them when needed. Simply put, we need a container that can hold data.

All programming languages provide a feature called **variables** to solve this problem. Variables, as the name suggests, can change.

#### Var2

```java
package variable;

public class Var2 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a; //Variable declaration
        a = 10; //Variable initialization
        System.out.println(a);
        System.out.println(a);
        System.out.println(a);
    }
}
```

#### Execution Result for a = 10

```bash
10
10
10
```

Now let's change it to `a = 20` and run it.

#### Var2

```java
package variable;

public class Var2 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a;              // Variable declaration
        a = 20;             // Changed 10 -> 20
        System.out.println(a);
        System.out.println(a);
        System.out.println(a);
    }
}
```

#### Execution Result for a = 20
```bash
20
20
20
```

You can see that when the value of `a` is changed, all output results change together.

#### Variable Declaration

`int a`
- Creates a data storage space named `a` that can store integer numbers (`integer`). This is called a variable.
- Creating a variable in this way is called variable declaration.
- Now the variable `a` can store integer numbers.
- There are variables that can store various types of values, not just integers, such as characters and decimals. For now, remember `int`, which stores integer numbers.

#### Assigning Values to Variables

`a = 10`
- In Java, `=` means storing the value on the right side into the left side. This is different from saying two values are equal (`equals`) in mathematics!
- Stores the value `10` into the variable `a`, which is a data storage space that can hold numbers.
- Assigning and storing a value to a declared variable for the first time like this is called variable initialization.

#### Reading Variable Values

`System.out.println(a)`
- The method to read and use values stored in variables is simple. Just write the variable name.
- If the variable `a` contains `10`, Java reads the variable's value at runtime and uses it. Therefore, it is interpreted as follows:
    - `System.out.println(a)   //Reads the value of variable a`
    - `System.out.println(10)  //Changed to 10, which is the value of a, outputs the number 10`
- Note that variable values can be read repeatedly. Reading a variable's value doesn't make it disappear.

### Changing Variable Values

Variables, as the name suggests, are values that can change. Simply put, it means you can change the value stored in variable `a` at any time.
This time, let's change the variable's value in the middle.

#### Var3

```java
package variable;

public class Var3 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a;           //Variable declaration
        a = 10;          //Variable initialization: a(10)
        System.out.println(a);    //Outputs 10
        a = 50;          //Variable value change: a(10 -> 50)
        System.out.println(a);    //Outputs 50
    }
}
```

#### Execution Result
```bash
10
50
```

You can see that after the variable's value was changed, 50 was output instead of 10.
