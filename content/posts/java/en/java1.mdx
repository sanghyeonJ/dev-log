### Hello java

```java
public class HelloJava {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("hello java");
    }
}
```

##### Note

Java is case-sensitive. Different cases may cause errors.

### Execution Result

```bash
hello java
```

##### public class HelloJava

- `HelloJava` is called a class. You need to learn the concept of classes to understand this.
- For now, simply understand that we created a file called `HelloJava.java`.
- The filename and class name must be the same.
- Use `{}` blocks to indicate the start and end of a class.

##### public static void main(String[] args)

- This is called the `main` method. You need to learn the concepts of functions and methods to understand this. Functions and methods will be covered later.
- Java finds the `main(String[] args)` method and starts the program.
- For now, simply understand that `main` is the entry point of the program.
- Use `{}` blocks to indicate the start and end of a method.

##### System.out.println("hello java");

- `System.out.println()` : A function that outputs values to the console.
- `"hello java"` : Java uses `"` (double quotes) when working with strings. Simply wrap your desired string between double quotes.
- `;` : Java uses semicolons to separate statements. You must include a semicolon at the end of every statement.

### Execution Process

1. Execute the `HelloJava` program.
2. Java executes the `main()` method, which is the entry point.
3. When it encounters `System.out.println("hello java")`, it outputs the string `hello java`.
4. When the `{}` block of the `main()` method ends, the program terminates.

### Block Example

```java
public class HelloJava {                      //Start of HelloJava class scope
    public static void main(String[] args) {  //Start of main() method scope
        System.out.println("hello java");
    }                                         //End of main() method scope
}                                             //End of HelloJava class scope
```

- You can see that indentation is applied whenever a block (`{}`) starts and ends. This is a good convention that helps distinguish and understand code easily. Each time blocks are nested, the indentation depth increases.
- Indentation typically uses 4 spaces. Note that in IntelliJ IDE, pressing the `Tab` key once automatically applies 4 spaces.
- Note that the program will work even without indentation. However, it makes the code harder to read.

## Summary

Here's a summary of the basic structure and execution process of Java programs:

#### Basic Structure of Java Programs

- **Class**: `public class HelloJava` - The filename and class name must be the same
- **Method**: `public static void main(String[] args)` - The entry point of the program
- **Block**: `{}` - Indicates the scope of classes and methods
- **Statement Separator**: `;` (semicolon) - Required at the end of every statement

#### Key Concepts

- **Output**: `System.out.println()` - Function to output values to the console
- **String**: `"string"` - Expressed by wrapping text in double quotes
- **Indentation**: Improves code readability as blocks are nested (typically 4 spaces)

#### Execution Flow

1. Program execution
2. Find `main()` method
3. Execute code inside the method
4. Terminate when block ends

#### Important Notes

- Java is **case-sensitive**
- The filename and class name **must be the same**
- You must add a **semicolon(`;`)** at the end of every statement
- Indentation is not required but **recommended for code readability**
