Variables exist in various formats depending on the type of data they handle.  
Let's run the following code.

```java
package variable;

public class Var1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 100;             //Integer
        double b = 10.5;         //Floating point number
        boolean c = true;        //Boolean - can input true, false
        char d = 'A';            //Single character
        String e = "Hello Java"; //String - special type for handling strings
        System.out.println(a);
        System.out.println(b);
        System.out.println(c);
        System.out.println(d);
        System.out.println(e);
    }
}
```

#### Execution Result

```java
100
10.5
true
A
Hello Java
```

Variables exist in various formats depending on the type of data they handle. These formats are called `types` in English.

- `int` : Handles integers. Examples: `1`, `100`, `1000`
- `double` : Handles floating point numbers. Examples: `0.2`, `1.5`, `100.121`
- `boolean` : Called boolean type. Can only use `true` and `false` values. Mainly used for determining true or false.
- `char` : Used when handling a single character. Must be wrapped with single quotes (`'`). Examples: `'A'`, `'가'`
- `String` : Handles strings. Must use double quotes. Example: `"hello java"`

**Note**: `String` is a special type that starts with an uppercase letter. You'll need to learn about classes later to understand this in detail. For now, just understand that it's a special type for handling strings. We'll cover `String` in detail separately.

#### Using Data That Matches Your Type

Each variable must use values that match its specified type. For example, the first two codes below will cause compile errors:

- `int a = "백원"` : String in integer type (X)
- `int a = "100"` : String in integer type (X), this is the string `"100"`, not the number 100. It's wrapped in double quotes (`"`) which represent characters.
- `int a = 100` : Integer 100 in integer type (O)

### Literals

Fixed values that developers write directly in code, such as `100`, `10.5`, `true`, `'A'`, `"Hello Java"`, are called literals in programming terminology.

```java
int a = 100;             //Integer literal
double b = 10.5;         //Floating point literal
boolean c = true;        //Boolean literal
char d = 'A';            //Character literal
String e = "Hello Java"; //String literal
```

Variable values can change, but literals are fixed values that developers input directly. Therefore, literals themselves do not change.

#### The Meaning of 'Literals Themselves Do Not Change'

To explain with an analogy:  
**Variable** = **Box**  
**Literal** = **Coin put in the box**  
- You can put a 100 won coin (100) in the box (a)
- Then replace it with a 200 won coin (200)  
However,
- The 100 won coin didn't change into a 200 won coin
- You just put in a different coin
