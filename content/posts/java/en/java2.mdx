### Comments

When source code becomes complex, you may want to add explanations to help understand the code.
Or you might want to temporarily disable certain code without deleting it.
In such cases, you can use comments. Java ignores anything marked as a comment.

##### Types of Comments
- Single line comment
    - Starts with the `//` symbol. All text after this symbol is treated as a comment.
- Multi line comment
    - Starts with `/*` and ends with `*/`. All text between these symbols is treated as a comment.

### CommentJava

```java
public class CommentJava {
    /*
    This section explains comments.
    */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("hello java1"); //Outputs hello java1. (single line comment - partial application)
        //System.out.println("hello java2"); Single line comment - applies to entire line
        /* Multi line comment
        System.out.println("hello java3");
        System.out.println("hello java4");
        */
    }
}
```

### Execution Result

```bash
hello java1
```

- You can see that the code marked as comments was not executed.
- Simply put, comments are parts that the Java program ignores and doesn't read. They are used for humans to read.
